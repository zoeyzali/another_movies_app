#### Frontend task - Movie API
Level: Intermediate

Hi there! We have a task for you if you want to join our web team @COBE!

Have you ever been in a situation when you didn't know which movie to watch? Your task is to build a web application for browsing movies. With Movie Roulette feature users can easily get recommended movies by genre they prefer!

Concept
We will provide you with a rough concept and an idea. Be creative, you can freestyle it however you like.

##### Main screen
This is the main screen of the app.

- As a user I want to be able to scroll through the list of movies. This list should give me a short info about each movie including movie title, cover image, year, rating and language
- As a user I want to be able to click on the specific movie and get to the page with all details about the chosen movie
- As a user I want to click on the LOAD button at the end of the list to load more movies
- As a user I want to be able to open Movie Roulette modal by clicking on the floating button in the bottom right corner

##### MovieDetails 
- As a user I want to get some details about specific movie including movie title, cover image, year, description, rating popularity, language and production companies
- As a user I want to rate a movie by clicking on the star icon (0-10)
- As a user I want to see my rating if I've already rated a specific movie


##### Movies Roulette 
- As a user I want to get a random movie by genre and see its details because I'm not sure what to watch
